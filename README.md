# Final Project of MFIT5010 - Statistical machine learning
Implement LDA with a variational EM algorithm, infer the topics and evaluate the performance using the demo dataset 'text_data.txt' with K=3 topics. There are 300 documents comprising 100 word in the vocabulary, where each row represents a document, each colum represents a word and the i,j-th entry value is the times of the j-th word showing up in the i-th document. Compare the results with the true document distribution stored in Ô¨Åle 'topic_doc_true.txt'. If possible, apply your implementation to the real dataset 'cora_data.txt', which contains. Discuss the results.
